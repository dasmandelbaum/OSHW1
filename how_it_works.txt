How the system works now:

1) turn on server.
    
    - ex. ./server 8181 ./index.html &

2) turn on any number of clients

3) run get request with clients

     - ex. ./client localhost 2003 /index.html
    
4) server forks, creating a new process for each client

    - currently line 194 in server.c

5) process fulfil clients' requests
    
    - web() method called by line 200 in server.c

6) client process closed

    - currently line 202 in server.c
